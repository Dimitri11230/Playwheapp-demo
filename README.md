# Playwheapp-demo
My IOS App! Collaborated with Yashodan Singh. Playwheapp version 1.0. that acts as a companion app for the popular gambling game PlayWhe in Trinidad and Tobago. I am yet to perfect and properly implement the ML part in the app (nlp and text classification but I have python/Colab models that I'm still working on) or the social networking features as yet but I will sketch out the plan. See my app the other apps of my classmates featured here: http://nyu-ios.herokuapp.com/14/ 



UPDATE 12/16/20
The current "ML" prediction functionality in the app is a really crude/naive model that I coded up myself using dictionaries. That model is not really a ML model. The stuff that I am currently working on are proper ML models- CNN, MLP, and Random Forests and seem to work the best so far. I need to move it from a Colab/python environment to Xcode/ObjC/Swift or integrate it in.

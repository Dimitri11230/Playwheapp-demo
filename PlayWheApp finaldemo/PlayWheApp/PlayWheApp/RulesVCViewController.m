In PlayWhe, players choose numbers (between 1-36 ) called 'marks' to bet on, similar to the game Roulette.\n \nUnlike Roulette, the numbers/marks each have a unique name and symbol and  players choose their lucky numbers/marks based on their dreams,visions and superstition.\n \nThere is a popular belief that one's dreams give insight into the winning numbers and this is the central theme of PlayWhe: Listen to the voice within!";
